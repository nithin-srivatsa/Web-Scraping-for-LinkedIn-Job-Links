# Web-Scraping-for-LinkedIn-Job-Links
This Python program is one I created 3 months ago. 
It uses BeautifulSoup, requests and pandas to scrape LinkedIn links and also automatically create and update an Excel file.
This file will contain the name of the company, the title of the job, the date you applied to the job, and the link to the job to help candidates like myself track their applications. 
I am using this personally to track my internship search.

To use this program, all you need to do is run all the code cells, and then simply enter the LinkedIn job URL using shift-enter.
This URL can be obtained easily by clicking on the job you wish to apply to, then click on the arrow on the top right. Then, click on "copy link".
The program will then automatically create an Excel file and download it to your system. 
If you don't mind having new files each time, you do not need to make any other changes.
if you want to update the same file, then you need to specify the path in the code cell that has the path mentioned as Downloads by default.
